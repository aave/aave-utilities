<h1 align="center">Aave Utilities</h1>

The Aave Protocol is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol
where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. The protocol is a set of
open source smart contracts which facilitate the logic of user interactions. 
These contracts, and all user transactions/balances are stored on a
public ledger called a blockchain, making them accessible to anyone

Aave Utilities is a JavaScript SDK for interacting with V2 and V3 of the Aave
Protocol, an upgrade to the existing [aave-js](https://github.com/aave/aave-js)
library

The `@aave/math-utils` package contains methods for formatting raw
([ethers.js](#ethers.js)) or indexed ([subgraph](#subgraph),
[caching server](#caching-server)) contract data for usage on a frontend

The `@aave/contract-helpers` package contains methods for generating trancations
based on method and parameter inputs. Can be used to read and write data on the
protocol contracts.

<br />

## Installation

Aave utilities are available as npm packages,
[contract helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aave/contract-helpers) and
[math utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aave/math-utils)

[ethers v5](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and [reflect-metadata](reflect metadata)
are peer dependencies of the contract-helpers package

```sh
// with npm
npm install --save-dev ethers reflect-metadata
npm install @aave/contract-helpers @aave/math-utils

// with yarn
yarn add --dev ethers reflect-metadata
yarn add @aave/contract-helpers @aave/math-utils
```

# Data Formatting Methods

Users interact with the Aave protocol through a set of smart contracts. The
`@aave/math-utils` package is a collection of methods to take raw input data
from these contracts, and format to use on a frontend interface such as
[Aave Ui](https://github.com/aave/aave-ui) or
[Aave info](https://github.com/sakulstra/info.aave)

## Fetching Protocol Data

Input data for these methods can be obtained in a variety of ways with some
samples below:

- [ethers](#ethers.js)
- [Subgraph](#subgraph)
- [Caching Server](#caching-server)

<br />

### ethers.js

[ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) is a library for interacting with
Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains. To install:

The first step to query contract data with ethers is to inialize a `provider`,
there are a [variety](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/) to choose from,
all of them requiring the an rpcURL

The sample code below includes an example of initializing a provider, and using
it query the helper contract data which can be passed directly into data
formatting methods.

<details>
	<summary>Sample Code</summary>

```ts
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import {
  UiPoolDataProvider,
  UiIncentiveDataProvider,
  ChainId,
} from '@aave/contract-helpers';

// Sample RPC address for querying ETH mainnet
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/demo',
);

// This is the provider used in Aave UI, it checks the chainId locally to reduce RPC calls with frequent network switches, but requires that the rpc url and chainId to remain consistent with the request being sent from the wallet (i.e. actively detecting the active chainId)
const provider = new ethers.providers.StaticJsonRpcProvider(
  'https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/demo',
  ChainId.mainnet,
);

// Aave protocol contract addresses, will be different for each market and can be found at https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts
// For V3 Testnet Release, contract addresses can be found here https://github.com/aave/aave-ui/blob/feat/arbitrum-clean/src/ui-config/markets/index.ts
const uiPoolDataProviderAddress = '0xa2DC1422E0cE89E1074A6cd7e2481e8e9c4415A6';
const uiIncentiveDataProviderAddress =
  '0xD01ab9a6577E1D84F142e44D49380e23A340387d';
const lendingPoolAddressProvider = '0xB53C1a33016B2DC2fF3653530bfF1848a515c8c5';

// User address to fetch data for
const currentAccount = '';

// View contract used to fetch all reserves data (including market base currency data), and user reserves
const poolDataProviderContract = new UiPoolDataProvider({
  uiPoolDataProviderAddress,
  provider,
  chainId: ChainId.mainnet,
});

// View contract used to fetch all reserve incentives (APRs), and user incentives
const incentiveDataProviderContract = new UiIncentiveDataProvider({
  uiIncentiveDataProviderAddress,
  provider,
  chainId: ChainId.mainnet,
});

// Note, contract calls should be performed in an async block, and updated on interval or on network/market change

// Object containing array of pool reserves and market base currency data
// { reservesArray, baseCurrencyData }
const reserves = await poolDataProviderContract.getReservesHumanized({
  lendingPoolAddressProvider,
});

// Object containing array or users aave positions and active eMode category
// { userReserves, userEmodeCategoryId }
const userReserves = await poolDataProviderContract.getUserReservesHumanized({
  lendingPoolAddressProvider,
  currentAccount,
});

// Array of incentive tokens with price feed and emission APR
const reserveIncentives =
  await incentiveDataProviderContract.getReservesIncentivesDataHumanized({
    lendingPoolAddressProvider,
  });

// Dictionary of claimable user incentives
const userIncentives =
  await incentiveDataProviderContract.getUserReservesIncentivesDataHumanized({
    lendingPoolAddressProvider,
    currentAccount,
  });
```

These four variables are passed as parameters into the [reserve](#reserve-data)
and [user](#user-data) formatters to compute all of the fields needed for a
frontend interface.

</details>

<br />

### Subgraph

A subgraph indexes events emitted from a smart contract and exposes a graphql
endpoing to query data from. Each network where the protocol is deployed is a
corresponding subgraph. Subgraph can be queried directly using the playground
(links below) and integrated into applications directly via TheGraph API. Check
out these guides from
[Aave](https://docs.aave.com/developers/getting-started/using-graphql) and
[TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/querying-from-your-app/) for
resources on querying subgraph from a frontend application.

Here are queries for fetching the data fields required for
[data formatting methods](#data-formatting-methods). The formatting methods are
the same for V2 and V3, but the queries required to fetch the input data are
different. Queries will depend on two parameters:

- `pool` : lendingPoolAddressProvider address for the market you are querying
  data for
- `user` : user to fetch account data for

<details>
	<summary>V2</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>Reserves</summary>

```graphql
{
  reserves(
    where: { pool: "insert_lowercase_lending_pool_address_provider_here" }
  ) {
    id
    symbol
    name
    decimals
    underlyingAsset
    usageAsCollateralEnabled
    reserveFactor
    baseLTVasCollateral
    averageStableRate
    stableDebtLastUpdateTimestamp
    liquidityIndex
    reserveLiquidationThreshold
    reserveLiquidationBonus
    variableBorrowIndex
    variableBorrowRate
    liquidityRate
    totalPrincipalStableDebt
    totalScaledVariableDebt
    lastUpdateTimestamp
    availableLiquidity
    stableBorrowRate
    totalLiquidity
    price {
      priceInEth
    }
  }
}
```

Then formatted to match expected input schema with:

```ts
const reserves = queryResult.reserves.map(reserve => {
  return {
    ...reserve,
    priceInMarketReferenceCurrency: reserve.price.priceInEth,
    eModeCategoryId: 0,
    borrowCap: '',
    supplyCap: '',
    debtCeiling: '',
    debtCeilingDecimals: 0,
    isolationModeTotalDebt: '',
    eModeLtv: 0,
    eModeLiquidationThreshold: 0,
    eModeLiquidationBonus: 0,
  };
});
```

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>User Reserves</summary>

```graphql
{
  userReserves(where: {pool: "insert_lowercase_lending_pool_address_provider_here", user: "insert_lowercase_user_address_here"}) {
    reserve{
      underlyingAsset
    }
    scaledATokenBalance
    usageAsCollateralEnabledOnUser
    stableBorrowRate
    scaledVariableDebt
    principalStableDebt
    stableBorrowLastUpdateTimestamp
  }
  }
}
```

Then formatted to match expected input schema with:

```ts
const userReserves = queryResults.userReserves.map(userReserve => {
  return {
    ...userReserve,
    underlyingAsset: userReserve.reserve.underlyingAsset,
  };
});
```

The `userEmodeCategoryId` parameter will always be 0 for V2 markets.

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Base Currency Data</summary>

```graphql
{
  priceOracles {
    usdPriceEth
  }
}
```

For ETH-based markets (all V2 markets except Avalanche):

- `marketReferencePriceInUsd` = 1 / (queryResult.priceOracles[0].usdPriceEth /
  (10 \*\* 18))

- `marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals` = 18

For USD-based markets (Avalanche and all v3 markets):
    
- `marketReferencePriceInUsd` = "100000000"

- `marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals` = 8

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Incentives</summary>

Samples for incentives data coming soon. Uses `incentivesControlllers` field and
maps incentives to reserves and userReserves.

  </details>

</details>

<details>
	<summary>V3</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>Reserves</summary>

```graphql
{
  reserves(
    where: { pool: "insert_lowercase_lending_pool_address_provider_here" }
  ) {
    id
    symbol
    name
    decimals
    underlyingAsset
    usageAsCollateralEnabled
    reserveFactor
    baseLTVasCollateral
    averageStableRate
    stableDebtLastUpdateTimestamp
    liquidityIndex
    reserveLiquidationThreshold
    reserveLiquidationBonus
    variableBorrowIndex
    variableBorrowRate
    liquidityRate
    totalPrincipalStableDebt
    totalScaledVariableDebt
    lastUpdateTimestamp
    availableLiquidity
    stableBorrowRate
    totalLiquidity
    price {
      priceInEth
    }
    eModeCategoryId
    borrowCap
    supplyCap
    debtCeiling
    debtCeilingDecimals
    isolationModeTotalDebt
    eModeLtv
    eModeLiquidationThreshold
    eModeLiquidationBonus
  }
}
```

Then formatted to match expected input schema with:

```ts
const reserves = queryResults.map(queryResult => {
  return {
    ...queryResult,
    priceInMarketReferenceCurrency: queryResult.price.priceInEth,
  };
});
```

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>User Reserves</summary>

```graphql
{
  userReserves(
    where: {
      pool: "insert_lowercase_lending_pool_address_provider_here"
      user: "insert_lowercase_user_address_here"
    }
  ) {
    reserve {
      underlyingAsset
    }
    scaledATokenBalance
    usageAsCollateralEnabledOnUser
    stableBorrowRate
    scaledVariableDebt
    principalStableDebt
    stableBorrowLastUpdateTimestamp
    user {
      eModeCategoryId {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then formatted to match expected input schema with:

```ts
const userReserves = queryResults.map(queryResult => {
  return {
    ...queryResult,
    underlyingAsset: queryResult.reserve.underlyingAsset,
  };
});
```

The field `queryResults[0].user.eModeCategoryId.id` is the active eModeCategory
and will input to the user formatters separately.

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Base Currency Data</summary>
    
All V3 market use USD based oracles, so baseCurrencyData can be hardcoded:

- `marketReferencePriceInUsd` = "100000000"

- `marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals` = 8

  </details>

<details>
    <summary>Incentives</summary>

Samples for incentives data coming soon. Uses `incentivesControlllers` field and
maps incentives to reserves and userReserves.

</details>

</details>

### Caching Server

Given that the Aave Ui has decentralized hosting with IPFS, it makes sense to
not require any API keys to run the UI, but this means only public rpc endpoints
are used which are quickly rate limited. To account for this, Aave has publushed
a [caching server](https://github.com/aave/aave-ui-caching-server) to perform
contract queries on one server, then serve this data to all frontend users
through a graphQL endpoint.

The four queries to fetch input data (in both query and subscription form) are
located
[here](https://github.com/aave/aave-ui/tree/master/src/libs/caching-server-data-provider/graphql)
in the follow files:

- protocol-data.graphql
- user-data.graphql
- incentives-data.graphql
- user-incentives-data.graphql

Examples of hooks for fetching data with these queries are located
[here](https://github.com/aave/aave-ui/tree/master/src/libs/caching-server-data-provider/hooks).

<br />

## Reserve Data

Formatted reserve data is an array of tokens in the Aave market, containing
realtime, human-readable data above asset configuration (maxLtv,
liquidationThreshold, usageAsCollateral, etc.) and current status (rates,
liquidity, utilization, etc.)

There are two formatter functions, one with incentives data and one without.
Both require input data from the
[fetching protocol data](#fetching-protocol-data) section

### formatReserves

formatReserves returns an array of formatted configuration and status data for
each reserve in an Aave market

<details>
  <summary>Sample Code</summary>

```ts
import { formatReserves } from '@aave/math-utils';
import dayjs from 'dayjs';

// reserves input from Fetching Protocol Data section

const reservesArray = reserves.reservesData;
const baseCurrencyData = reserves.baseCurrencyData;

const currentTimestamp = dayjs().unix();

/*
- @param `reserves` Input from [Fetching Protocol Data](#fetching-protocol-data), `reserves.reservesArray`
- @param `currentTimestamp` Current UNIX timestamp in seconds
- @param `marketReferencePriceInUsd` Input from [Fetching Protocol Data](#fetching-protocol-data), `reserves.baseCurrencyData.marketReferencePriceInUsd`

*/
const formattedPoolReserves = formatReserves({
  reserves: reservesArray,
  currentTimestamp,
  marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals:
    baseCurrencyData.marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals,
  marketReferencePriceInUsd: baseCurrencyData.marketReferenceCurrencyPriceInUsd,
});
```

</details>

<br />

### formatReservesAndIncentives

formatReservesAndIncentives returns an array of formatted configuration and
status data plus an object with supply, variable borrow, and stable borrow
incentives for each reserve in an Aave market

<details>
  <summary>Sample Code</summary>

```ts
import { formatReservesAndIncentives } from '@aave/math-utils';
import dayjs from 'dayjs';

// 'reserves' and 'reserveIncentives' inputs from Fetching Protocol Data section

const reservesArray = reserves.reservesData;
const baseCurrencyData = reserves.baseCurrencyData;

const currentTimestamp = dayjs().unix();

/*
- @param `reserves` Input from [Fetching Protocol Data](#fetching-protocol-data), `reserves.reservesArray`

const formattedPoolReserves = formatReservesAndIncentives({
  reserves: reservesArray,
  currentTimestamp,
  marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals:
    baseCurrencyData.marketReferenceCurrencyDecimals,
  marketReferencePriceInUsd: baseCurrencyData.marketReferenceCurrencyPriceInUsd,
  reserveIncentives,
});
```

</details>

<br />

## User Data

totalLiquidity, totalBorrows, etc.) and an array of formatted reserve data plus
user holdings (aTokens, debtTokens) for each reserve in an Aave market

### formatUserSummary

Returns formatted summary of Aave user portfolio including: array of holdings,
total liquidity, total collateral, total borrows, liquidation threshold, health
factor, and available borrowing power

<details>

# Transaction Methods

The transaction methods package provides an sdk to interact with Aave Protocol
contracts. See [ethers.js](#ethers.js) for instructions on installing setting up
and ethers provider

Once initialized this sdk can be used to generate the transaction data needed to
perform an action. If an approval is required, the method will return an array
with two transactions, or single transaction if no approval is needed.

## Submitting Transactions

All transaction methods will return an array of transaction objects of this
type:

```ts
import { EthereumTransactionTypeExtended } from '@aave/contract-helpers';
```

To send a transaction from this object:

```ts
import { BigNumber, providers } from 'ethers';

function submitTransaction({
  provider: providers.Web3Provider,  // Signing transactions requires a wallet provider, Aave UI currently uses web3-react (https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) for connecting wallets and accessing the wallet provider
  tx: EthereumTransactionTypeExtended
}){
  const extendedTxData = await tx.tx();
  const { from, ...txData } = extendedTxData;
  const signer = provider.getSigner(from);
  const txResponse = await signer.sendTransaction({
    ...txData,
    value: txData.value ? BigNumber.from(txData.value) : undefined,
  });
}
```

## Pool V3

Transaction methods to perform actions on the V3 Pool contract

### supply

Formerly `deposit`, supply the underlying asset into the Pool reserve. For every
token that is supplied, a corresponding amount of aTokens is minted

<details>
  <summary>Sample Code</summary>

```ts
import { Pool } from '@aave/contract-helpers';

const pool = new Pool(provider, {
  POOL: poolAddress,
  WETH_GATEWAY: wethGatewayAddress,
});

/*
- @param `user` The ethereum address that will make the deposit 
- @param `reserve` The ethereum address of the reserve 
- @param `amount` The amount to be deposited 
- @param @optional `onBehalfOf` The ethereum address for which user is depositing. It will default to the user address
*/
const txs: EthereumTransactionTypeExtended[] = await pool.supply({
  user,
  reserve,
  amount,
  onBehalfOf,
});

// If the user has not appoved the pool contract to spend their tokens, txs will also contain two transactions: approve and supply. These approval and supply transactions can be submitted just as in V2,OR you can skip the first approval transaction with a gasless signature by using signERC20Approval -> supplyWithPermit which are documented below

// If there is no approval transaction, then supply() can called without the need for an approval or signature
```

Submit transaction(s) as shown [here](#submitting-transactions)

</details>

<br />

### signERC20Approval

This method is used to generate the raw signature data to be signed by the user.
Once generated, a function is called to trigger a signature request from the
users wallet. This signature can be passed a parameter to `supplyWithPermit` or
`repayWithPermit` in place of an approval transaction.

Note: Not all tokens are compatible with the ERC-2612 permit functionality. You
can check the
<a href="https://github.com/aave/interface/blob/main/src/ui-config/permitConfig.ts" target="_blank">Aave
interface config</a> for an updated list of supported tokens by network.

<details>
  <summary>Sample Code</summary>

```ts
import { Pool } from '@aave/contract-helpers';

const pool = new Pool(provider, {
  POOL: poolAddress,
  WETH_GATEWAY: wethGatewayAddress,
});

/*
- @param `user` The ethereum address that will make the deposit 
- @param `reserve` The ethereum address of the reserve 
- @param `amount` The amount to be deposited 
- @param `deadline` Expiration of signature in seconds, for example, 1 hour = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000 + 3600).toString()
